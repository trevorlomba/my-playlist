# My Playlist by Trevor Lomba

A single-page application with user authentication that interacts with a custom API served by Express. Registered users can create, read, update, and delete songs as part of a database of playlists, which is mapped to rows of a table and displayed on the DOM.

### Quick Links - 

* [deployed app](https://trevorlomba.github.io/my-playlist-client/)

* [frontend repo](https://github.com/trevorlomba/my-playlist-client)

* [backend repo](https://github.com/trevorlomba/my-playlist)

With this tool you are able to create a 'playlist' with multiple songs with information for each including title, artist, album, and isrc #. Users are only able to access the songs that they input into the system themselves using a personal login.

Future plans include building this out into a sample/music recommendation engine using Spotify's API. 

### Wireframes

### User Stories
    As a user I can sign in/up, change password, and sign out
    As a user I can add songs to a 'playlist' of favorite songs using identifying information eg song title, artist name, album, ISRC Code
    As a user I can remove songs from said playlist
    As a user I can favorite songs without adding them to a playlist


## Tasks

Instead of `grunt`, this template uses `npm` as a task runner. This is more
conventional for modern Express apps, and it's handy because we'll definitely
use `npm` anyway. These are the commands available:

| Command                | Effect                                                                                                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run server`       | Starts a development server with `nodemon` that automatically refreshes when you change something.                                                                                         |
| `npm test`             | Runs automated tests.                                                                                       |
| `npm run debug-server` | Starts the server in debug mode, which will print lots of extra info about what's happening inside the app. |
